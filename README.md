3/2
A project that can store and display a library of the users books. This project was aimed to practice DOM elements and working with objects.

There is still room for improvement in the JavaScript code which will be fixed once I learn more about DOM methods and general optimization. I would also like to add a web storage feature so the books within the library aren't deleted and the user can come back to their collection. I would also like to spend more time with the HTML & CSS files to adjust the display of the book cards.
